# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add `LICENSE` file (was documented in `package.json`, but physical file was
  missing)
- Add `"description"`, `"bugs"`, `"homepage"` keys to `package.json`

## [1.0.1] - 2017-11-21
### Added
- Link to `instant-map` example
- Add documentation in `README`
- Add `"resetOverlayLayers"` event listener

### Changed
- Add `.md` extension to `README`
- Renamed UMD export from `PrebakedLeafletMap` to `PrebakedGeoJSONMap`
  (`PrebakedLeafletMap` was the original name, but felt less accurate).
  This is a breaking change, but this module doesn't have any users currently,
  so it's just being marked as a patch release.

### Fixed
- Fix crashes for GeoJSON `Feature`s that don't include a `"properties"` key.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-11-20
### Added
- Initial release
